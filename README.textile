*Changelog*

_v0.6.4033_

* Added IsAbsoluteUrl property to the RouteAttributes, which prevents the RouteAreaAttribute and RoutePrefixAttribute from prefixing the URL for a route. This can be handy for legacy URL support.  
* Added Precedence property to the RouteAtrributes, which allows you to specify the precedence of a route among all the routes defined _for the controller_. 
* New and improved output from the LogRoutesHandler.
* New RouteConventionAttribute, which allows you to create your own convention-based route generator for actions within a controller. There is also a RestfulRouteConventionAttribute, which automatically creates RESTful routes for standard actions in your controller.
